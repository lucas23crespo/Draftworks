    content: `# From What to How: Reading Like a Writer

Mike Bunn’s “How to Read Like a Writer” flipped a switch inside my head: rather than chug through the text trying to get its “what,” I opened it and slowly consumed it for its “how,” making each sentence seem like a choice that I could learn and experience. In this reading, I began to catch the quiet engineering that goes into good prose: the hook that gets attention but does not oversell; the point at which a definition of everything implicit comes just before the psychological concept; the transition word which counsels the reader in which direction the succeeding paragraph is heading; the transfer from the long, involved sentence to bursts of phrase when the idea is psychologically dense; the order in which the evidences appear, to lessen the diligent effort of the reader. Bunn’s questions make it practical and discernable: Who is the audience? What is the purpose of the writer? Why this arrangement or structure or tone, or parable here? What particular form of extra thought is existing just now—anecdote, definition, counterargument, synthesis? And here I may well ask, how could I do that? Putting that thought especially into some recent part I have read, I found, as an anecdote in the beginning, to remove the difficulty of complexity, mid-section short paragraphs to keep tempo; the end was an echo of the beginning illustration, rather than a restatement of the thesis told in narrative, rather than a restatement of the thesis told in narrative, for the sake of better technique and style. My process is as follows: My annotations become craft maps which I formulate the important transitions, topic-sentences, etc.; I have a “move bank,” opening processes, etc., in which I put down ways of early planting counterarguments; and my process of revision becomes “What is there in need of fixing,” and “What is there of good work for this motive and audience?” Putting one move from each piece into the next piece of writing yields cumulative growth. Reading like a writer demystifies the quality of good work: it is not a series of miracles, but repeating purposeful movements.`,

    content: `Sample-based production is not just about replicating an original sound; it's about capturing a certain vibe, or emotional sensation. This is why so many artists sample with a nostalgic approach, as they understand that a familiar sonic reference, whether it be a chord progression, drum pattern, or ad-libbed vocal snippet, may quickly evoke a particular moment in time. That instant recall does not simply make something sound "good," it also gives a new song meaning by allowing listeners to connect with the artist's use of past sonic references, as well as connecting them to the listener's own memories.

The sampling cycle is easy to identify. The late '90s saw Hip-Hop borrowing heavily from Soul and Funk records that parents had stored away on Vinyl — dusty Rhodes chords, live bass lines and MPC swing. By the early 2010s, producers began to borrow heavily from the '80s — big gated drums, bright and shiny synth pads, Linn-style clap patterns and bright and colorful arpeggios. Fast forward to 2025, and the time machine has landed in the early 2000s. Early 2000s R & B runs, Nelly-esque melodies, Neptunes-style chopped up guitar riffs, Timbaland style beatboxing and stuttering, and Pop-Punk power chords are all being chopped, time stretched, formant shifted and re-harmonized. While the tools used in the creation of this sampled material are different (micro-chopping for bouncy rhythmic effects, transient shaping to keep the drum kit sounding modern, parallel distortion to add weight and tastefully applied auto-tune artifacts to create the correct era-specific color) the creative process remains very similar to previous decades. Many producers continue to chop short musical phrases and / or incorporate hooks into their productions to capture the essence of the original while avoiding the potential clearing issues associated with using too much of an original recording.

To many members of Generation Z, who have listened to these sounds through MTV, burning CD's, creating playlists via LimeWire and listening to their parents' radios, samples from the 2000s provide a sense of comfort and familiarity, while simultaneously providing a fresh, new sonic landscape. The blending of old and new is where the real magic happens — when a producer uses a Triton-era bell or a crunchy Pop-Punk riff and immediately thinks "I know this" but then realizes that the overall groove and tempo, along with the modern sound design, places it squarely in today. This is not just a current trend, it is actually how music continues to evolve. Every decade eventually becomes the "vintage fuel" for the next generation of artists and tomorrow's classics will be created using nothing other than the same sample packs of our youth as we do today with fresh synthesizers and field recordings. When done right, sampling is nothing more than cultural memory turned into rhythm.`,

    content: `1. "how to read like a writer," by mike bunn, is a way of thinking about reading rather than simply a book; he states that reading with a writer's eye is to slow down enough to see the decisions an author has made (the way an author begins their writing, the shape of each sentence, the transition between ideas, the evidence to support the argument, the tone) and then determine why they were made and how these decisions create impact so that you can take some of these decisions and use them in your own writing, modify them, or eliminate them; the most successful aspect of the essay are its practical suggestions, breaking down the craft of writing into repetitive questions ("what is the author attempting to accomplish?"), ("does the structure of this assist the author?", ("what would happen if I deleted this?")) and suggesting that you make margin notes that document the techniques used by the author, and not just the content; bunn also changes the perception of difficulty being an indicator of the reader and author working through the pace at which an idea is delivered; bunn invites readers to find out how a section was written to be slow and how the author created a specific pacing; bunn invites readers to discover how a paragraph was written to be exciting and how the author developed its rhythm, syntax, and detail; i particularly enjoy bunn's approach to defining the audience and purpose as guiding principles for all of the author's decisions; this creates "rules" based on the context of the intended audience and purpose of the text and transforms "tools" such as passive voice, long sentences, fragments, and cliche's into devices that authors can apply in a thoughtful and intentional manner; while the article contains little jargon, uses many examples and is therefore accessible to beginning writers, yet can still benefit experienced writers wishing to improve control over their writing; the article does require time and patience from the reader to allow for the application of bunn's method to produce results however, bunn believes that deliberate attention will result in growth, read fewer books, but read more thoughtfully, and observe the quality of your draft increase.

    content: `# The Writer's Guide to Effective Research

Research is the foundation of credible, engaging writing. Whether you're writing fiction or non-fiction, thorough research adds layers of authenticity that readers can feel.

## Research Strategies

- Start broad, then narrow your focus
- Use primary sources when possible
- Interview experts in the field
- Visit locations if feasible
- Keep meticulous notes

## Balancing Research and Writing

The challenge is knowing when to stop researching and start writing. Research should inform your work, not paralyze it.`,

    content: `# Overcoming Writer's Block

Every writer faces the dreaded blank page. The key is having strategies to push through these creative dry spells.

## Understanding the Block

Writer's block isn't laziness—it's often perfectionism, fear, or creative exhaustion in disguise.

## Proven Techniques

1. **Free Writing**: Write without stopping for 10 minutes
2. **Change Your Environment**: New settings spark new ideas
3. **Read Voraciously**: Fill the creative well
4. **Set Small Goals**: 100 words is better than zero
5. **Exercise**: Physical movement unlocks mental creativity

Remember: writing is a practice, not a performance.`,

    content: `# The Revision Process

Writing is rewriting. The first draft is just the beginning of the creative journey, not the end.

## Layers of Revision

1. **Structural Edit**: Does the overall architecture work?
2. **Content Edit**: Are ideas clear and well-developed?
3. **Line Edit**: Is every sentence as strong as it can be?
4. **Copy Edit**: Grammar, spelling, punctuation

## The Cooling Period

Always let your work rest before revising. Distance provides perspective that immediate review cannot.

## Getting Feedback

Trusted readers can spot issues you're too close to see. Choose them wisely and listen with an open mind.`,

      "Reflection on Wendy Bishop's essay about 'stealing' as close reading and craft.",

    content: `When I first began reading Wendy Bishop's essay "How to Read, Steal, and Write Like a Writer," I was unsure what she meant by "steal." At first I thought perhaps she was suggesting it is acceptable to copy another person's work. However, as I read further into the article, I quickly understood that Bishop was not referring to plagiarism. Instead, she illustrated how writers develop as writers by studying other writers -- examining the choices each writer makes, their rhythms, and their voice. Bishop states her primary thesis that good readers become good writers because reading and writing are mutually exclusive practices. In addition to understanding what a piece of writing is saying, good readers pay close attention to how the writer developed his/her message. Bishop calls this practice "reading like a writer" and has altered my perception of reading. Historically, I have been reading for only one reason: to comprehend what the writer intended. Today, I am beginning to read to examine how the writer accomplished his/her goals. For example, Bishop's tone is informal and welcoming -- it appears as if she is coaching the reader as opposed to simply lecturing them. To illustrate these stylistic techniques that help to create her engaging essay, Bishop utilizes repetition, direct address ("you"), and even humor to make her point. These stylistic techniques were so effective that I wanted to use a similar writing style for my own writing.

One of Bishop's most compelling arguments is that writing is a process of imitation, experimentation and transformation. Bishop suggests that writers should model the styles they appreciate -- however, not literally replicate them. She explains that writers who adopt the writing techniques they admire are not copying -- they are practicing. Just as artists may study the brush strokes of another painter, writers learn through tracing sentence structure, attempting various tones and analyzing how other writers resolve their rhetorical issues.

This concept ties directly to our discussions in class about "writing on commission." We write for particular reasons, audiences and contexts -- and Bishop illustrates how analyzing other writers assists in making informed decisions for your own "GAP" (Genre, Audience, and Purpose) in your writing. For instance, she examines how an author employs brief sentences to generate anxiety or lengthy ones to delay reflection. These are decisions I can now identify and attempt to implement when I draft my own essays or blog entries.

In addition, Bishop's essay assisted me in embracing failure. She states that to learn from other writers means you will be willing to risk, to test, and to fail. Her statement relates perfectly to Anne Lamott's concept of writing a "shitty first draft." Both authors emphasize that the imperfect beginnings of a project are not only acceptable -- but necessary. Prior to this course, I consistently attempted to craft each and every sentence to be flawless from the outset -- resulting in anxious and time-consuming writing. Currently, I perceive drafting much more positively. Each subsequent version is merely an alternative attempt at identifying what ultimately works best.

Ultimately, Wendy Bishop has demonstrated that "stealing" is essentially about paying attention. Reading must occur with such care that you understand not only what the writers are stating -- but how they are expressing themselves -- and then using those expressions to inspire your own writing. As I continue to develop my writing skills, I would like to continue to engage in this type of reading. I would like to continually notice, borrow, modify and ultimately establish my own voice through the process.`,

    content: `As I look back at Mike Bunn's "How to Read Like a Writer" and Wendy Bishop's "How to Read, Steal, and Write Like a Writer", I see that the two authors each take a very different way to get to the same end goal of finding connections between reading and writing. Although both authors are working to help develop writers - students who have not yet figured out how having knowledge of craft can positively affect their writing, they each achieve their ends through distinctly different tones and approaches.

Mike Bunn, uses a structured and analytical tone. He guides his readers to think about writing similar to an engineer thinking about a design blueprint. Wendy Bishop, however, uses a much more conversational and mentoring tone. She encourages her readers to experiment and reassure them that using other people's work as examples or "stealing" ideas, and that it is okay to make mistakes along the way, are all part of the learning process.

Although both authors' goals are the same (to create stronger and more thoughtful writers), the authors take a vastly different path. Bunn provides information based on craft mechanics - he asks questions, explains structural choices, and demonstrates how the choices writers make regarding transitions, pacing, and paragraph shapes will ultimately influence meaning. The primary focus of his strategies is on logic and structure. Bishop, however, focuses on writers' mindsets and processes. Her repetition, humor, and direct address ("you") provide emotional support to writers and remind them that taking inspiration from others does not constitute plagiarism, but rather, is a form of practice. She establishes her credibility (ethos) by sharing her own experiences with the imperfections involved with writing, providing new writers with permission to write imperfectly and openly.

Although there are significant stylistic differences between the two authors, both authors use examples of actual writing to demonstrate technique. However, they merely utilize the examples in different ways. Bunn deconstructs them, whereas Bishop views them as inspirational models. There appears to be a level of rhetorical overlap between the two authors in their belief that writing well depends upon reading consciously, but they share this commonality in differing ways — Bunn through precision and analysis, and Bishop through inspiration and experimentation. By viewing these two texts side-by-side, I was able to begin to recognize that the best rhetorical choices depend solely on GAP: genre, audience, and purpose. A technical, instructional tone is most effective when teaching readers where to "look" in a piece of writing, whereas a motivational, warm tone is most effective in reducing fear and inspiring creativity.

Together, the two texts have shaped my view of myself as both a writer and a reader. As a writer, I now recognize that progress is not accidental, it occurs due to observing deliberate patterns and then attempting to replicate those patterns through practice. Bunn provided me with tools to identify craft moves — hooks, strategic examples, pacing changes — while Bishop provided me with the confidence to borrow from those moves, and accept imperfect drafts. As a reader, the two texts have instructed me that reading is not a passive activity. Now, when I read, I pay attention to structure, tone, rhythm, and decisions, rather than passively absorbing meaning.

In conclusion, by combining the perspectives of Bunn and Bishop, I learned that writing is both a form of architecture and discovery. Writing is both a methodical, detailed, and aware-of-audience task — but also one that requires courage, experimentation, and the ability to fail and continue moving forward. When I read with intention and then write with flexibility, I am not simply copying techniques; I am creating and molding them into my own unique voice. This understanding — born from combining the perspectives of these two authors — is the foundation of genuine growth as a writer.`
